          caused inflation. I touched upon blame, what resilience is, and how
          industrial engineers and members of the public can seek to improve it.

          One of my regrets is my failure to delve into <i>how</i> the supply
          chain affects inflation. It's a complicated topic; I felt I lacked the
          flexibility and opportunity to expand on mechanics. Since this writing
          is more of a blog post, I have the freedom to use graphics to support
          the correlation between supply chain shocks and inflation. This post,
          however, is only a slightly deeper dive into a specific topic. I just
          wanted to elaborate a little more on something that I didn't touch
          upon.

          Supply chain issues manifest themselves in increased cost to operate —
          manufacturing, shipping, maintenance and storage factor into total
          cost. This is shown in the below chart as an index — aggregated and
          normalized or centered around 0, data. The inflation rate, the
          increase in prices since last year, is given as well.

          The two focal points of the chart are the correlation between supply
          chain costs and inflation, and the spike in supply chain costs in
          early 2021 as the country began to recover from COVID. I haven't seen
          this specific chart anywhere online; I've seen similar ones like the
          below graphic from the white house.

          Both charts show that supply chain costs increased heavily after
          covid, due to the aforementioned energy and goods demand spike, which
          is inflation. They also show that there's a slight “lag” to inflation
          from supply chain costs; the same relative increase or decrease in the
          supply chain index is then reflected in inflation. While correlation
          doesn't concretely prove causation, the lag and correlation before
          covid are indicators that supply chain costs affect inflation.
          Increased shipping costs increase the price of goods and services,
          which increases inflation, and the cycle repeats.

            >White House's article</a

          to abstract complicated supply chain topics into digestible ideas. It
          also talks about mitigation efforts through the president's, Joe
          Biden, perspective. The big “win” that reduced shipping costs and thus
          inflation was the Ocean Reform Shipping Act. They show figure 4 as
          evidence:

        <p>
          It's a little more complicated than that, however. The supply chain
          isn't the only inflationary factor; the aforementioned increased
          goods/energy demand, economic growth and construction are three of the
          many potential causes of inflation. At the height of supply chain
          issues, the Federal Bank instituted interest rate hikes; traditional
          economics stipulates that inflation and economic growth are positively
          correlated while interest rate is negatively correlated with both. In
          other words, as interest rates increase, both economic growth and
          inflation slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that no matter how well-written the article was or how
          effective the Ocean Reform Shipping Act was, it's important to take
          all factors into account. I just wanted to shed light on a factor
          that's tangent to my discipline.
